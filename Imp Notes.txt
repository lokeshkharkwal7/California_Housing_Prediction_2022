1. While downloading a file to a directory or moving a csv file you need to make sure that 
the path you make should also consist of the name of the file

eg: os.path.join("artifact_dir", "train_data") to 
    os.path.join("artifact_dir", "train_data" , "name_of_file.csv/name_of_file.tar")

1. We can compare 2 data frames using is statement

                                    if x_train is x_test:
                                                break
1. 
            # You can find any data you want in the dictionary in the dictionary using the below code:

    highest_score = max([ i['Model_score'] for i in yaml_data.values()])
    highest_score_model = [ i for i in yaml_data.values()  if i.get('Model_score')==highest_score]


Normal errors:
      importing error
      stupid arguments provided in the model.yaml file
      not assigning the dataframes to the right variables
      error while importing the modules dynamically


Solving problems while creating a virtual environment in vs code:
- Run vs code in admin mode 
- Run this script in terminal Get-ExecutionPolicy
- Run second Script in terminal Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
- Run final script in terminal venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
- Then install requirements.txt 

Now it will be done
